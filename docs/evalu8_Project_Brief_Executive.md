## What We're Building

A web-based platform that transforms how sports organizations evaluate players. The system automates scheduling, provides real-time scoring tools, and delivers ranked player reports while reducing administrative work.

---

## The Problem

Sports associations struggle with player evaluations because current systems are either too complex for evaluators to use in real-time or too simple to provide useful data for player assessment. Manual processes create inconsistencies, consume administrative time, and fail to deliver actionable insights.

**Impact:** Frustrated evaluators, unreliable data, excessive administrative overhead, and suboptimal player ranking decisions.

---

## Key Benefits

**For Organizations:**
- Reduction in administrative time for scheduling and reporting
- Standardized evaluation processes across all sessions
- Multi-sport compatibility (basketball, soccer, hockey, etc.)
- Scalable from 50 to 1000+ players

**For Evaluators:**
- Intuitive real-time scoring interface
- Anonymous evaluation reduces bias
- No technical expertise required

**For Player Assessment:**
- Comprehensive analytics and player rankings
- Multi-evaluator scoring ensures reliability
- 10-year historical data for trend analysis
- Quality control with automated outlier detection
- Quality validation evaluations for benchmarking accuracy

---

## Investment

**Development:**
- Solo developer project
- MVP approach with iterative delivery
- Modern technology stack (React + Supabase)
- Cloud-hosted infrastructure

**Ongoing:**
- Minimal hosting costs (cloud-based)
- Multi-tenant architecture reduces per-organization costs

---

## Technical Foundation

**Architecture:** Multi-tenant web platform with Google OAuth authentication  
**Performance:** 99.5% uptime, supports 10-20 concurrent evaluators  
**Security:** Role-based access control, data isolation, anonymous evaluation  
**Scale:** 50-1000+ players per organization

---

## Success Criteria

- 95% evaluator satisfaction with interface usability
- 90% administrator satisfaction with efficiency gains
- Reduction in scheduling errors
- 95% data accuracy in rankings and reports

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| User adoption resistance | Intuitive design, minimal training, early involvement |
| Data quality issues | Outlier detection, multi-evaluator requirements |
| Performance at scale | Load testing, horizontal scaling capability |
| Scope creep | Clear requirements, phased delivery approach |
